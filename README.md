~~new_app~~ No-name app
=======================

A quick experiment. An application to manage ~~music~~ image albums. 

No audio file will be uploaded nor your online music library will be accessed. An image can be uploaded and stored in db with its title. Images are searchable using your own keyword and each image comes with a delete button. 

It's meant to cover a few extra RESTful CRUD operations that Hartl's famous tutorial app does not cover but are commonly employed by many web services. It'll be built on the famous tutorial app. Therefore, the tweet functionality is also available together with the image album functionality.

Another functionality will be added as I wish to take on another project in the future.

~~Work in progress~~. Complete (for now as of 2013/07/06).
